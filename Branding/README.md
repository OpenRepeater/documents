Branding TODOS
* Create Square Companion Icon from tower in main logo for use for such things as Favicon, GitHub Organization profile picture, social network icon, etc. 
* Create two sets of logos, one with "project" and one without for use in UI and for marketing purposes and detail which should be use in different applications
* Create dark background variation of logo and perhaps a stacked alternative.
* Provide Areas of Isolation, how not to use the logo (stretching, etc), allowed colors for consistancy.
